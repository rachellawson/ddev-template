# DDEV Template

A drupal repo ready to do Drupal using GitHub Codespaces and DDEV.

# First install

To create a new repository from this template:

1. Create a new repository and choose this repository as the template
2. In the new repository, choose to start a Codespace
3. Wait! This bit takes a while as Codespaces creates your environment. Hang in there until Visual Studio has appeared, wait a little longer for the postCreateCommand to begin and complete and you reach a terminal prompt
4. Start DDEV and install all the required Drupal components with the command `ddev composer install`
5. In the Ports tab above the terminal, you will see the ports listed for things like the webserver, the database server etc. Click on the World icon next to the SSL port for the webserver and a new tab will open, inviting you to "install Drupal"
6. Install Drupal
7. Be gay, do crime.
